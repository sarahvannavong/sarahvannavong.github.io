  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am an undergraduate student majoring in Data Science with a minor in Statistics at
    UNC Charlotte. I am interested in using data to understand real-world problems,
    particularly those involving people, communities, and social systems.

  <h2>Portfolio / Projects</h2>
  <p>
    This section will showcase my data science projects throughout the semester.
    Projects will include data analysis, modeling, and reflections on ethical and
    social implications.

  <h3>Why Data Science in Social and Interdisciplinary Contexts Matters</h3>
  <p><em>Posted: January 2026</em></p>

  <p>
    Data science is often associated with numbers, algorithms, and technical systems,
    but behind nearly every dataset are real people and real social contexts. Learning
    data science through a social and interdisciplinary lens matters because data is
    rarely neutral. The way data is collected, modeled, and interpreted can shape public
    opinion, policy decisions, and individual lives.
  </p>

  <p>
    Modeling social topics and people allows us to better understand patterns that may
    not be visible at an individual level. For example, data can reveal inequalities in
    healthcare access, education outcomes, or economic opportunities. Without data,
    many of these issues remain anecdotal or overlooked. However, when we model people
    and social systems, we are also making choices about what to measure and what to
    ignore, which can unintentionally reinforce bias.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using data about people comes with responsibility. At this point in my learning, I
    recognize the importance of privacy, informed consent, and ethical use of data.
    Data scientists must be cautious not to reduce individuals to just numbers or labels.
    Misuse of data can lead to harmful stereotypes, unfair algorithms, or decisions that
    disproportionately affect marginalized communities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through this course, I hope to better understand how technical data science skills
    intersect with social responsibility. I want to learn not only how to build models,
    but also how to question their assumptions, limitations, and potential impacts.
    Ultimately, I hope this interdisciplinary approach will help me become a more
    thoughtful and ethical data scientist.
