    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Sarah Vannavong, and I am currently an undergraduate student at UNC Charlotte
      majoring in Data Science with a minor in Statistics. I enjoy learning about how data is
      used in everyday life and how it influences people and society. In my free time, I enjoy
      traveling, going to concerts and music festivals, and playing pickleball and golf.

    <h3>Why Data Science in Social and Interdisciplinary Contexts Matters</h3>
    <p><em>January 2026</em></p>

    <p>
      I’m excited about this course because I want to learn how data influences people and
      society, especially when it comes to real-world issues. The social science side of data
      science interests me because it focuses on understanding human behavior and the impact
      of decisions, not just building models. While data science is often associated with
      numbers, algorithms, and technical systems, behind nearly every dataset are real people
      and real social contexts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Modeling social topics and people allows us to better understand patterns that may not
      be visible at an individual level. Data can reveal inequalities in healthcare access,
      education outcomes, or economic opportunities. Without data, many of these issues
      remain anecdotal or overlooked. However, when modeling people and social systems, there
      are important decisions being made about what data is collected and what is left out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using data about people comes with responsibility. Privacy, informed consent, and ethical
      data use are all important considerations. Data scientists must be careful not to reduce
      individuals to numbers or labels. Bias in data can lead to unfair models and harmful
      outcomes, especially when data is used to make decisions that affect people’s lives.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through this course, I hope to better understand how technical data science skills
      intersect with social responsibility. I want to learn how to build models while also
      thinking critically about their assumptions, limitations, and real-world impact.
      Ultimately, learning data science in social contexts helps ensure that data is used in
      a thoughtful and ethical way.
